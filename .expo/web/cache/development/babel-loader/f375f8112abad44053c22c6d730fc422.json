The following code is exactly how it looks like. (x,y,w,h) is a pair where x and y are the coordinates of the top left corner of the rectangles for each face and w and h are the height and width. For each pair in the sequence of identified faces, use the cv2.rectangle function to draw a rectangle around it. The cv2.rectangle function takes the picture, the x and y coordinates of the top left corner and bottom left corner, the RGB color, and thickness of rectangle border.`,\n    code: `# Draw a rectangle around the faces\\nfor (x, y, w, h) in faces:\\ncv2.rectangle(picture, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)`\n  },\n  {\n    key: '16',\n    title: \"Show the Image\",\n    description: `Finally, the function cv2_imshow is used to display the picture to the screen including the rectangles drawn`,\n    code: `#show the image with the rectangle drawn around it\\ncv2_imshow(picture)`\n  },\n];\nexport default function Lessons({navigation}) {\n  const flatListRef = React.useRef()\n  const explosion = React.useRef()\n  const { width } = useWindowDimensions();\n  const [index, setIndex] = React.useState(0)\n  const [codeString, setCodeString] = React.useState(()=>{\n    let array = []\n    for (let index = 0; index < LessonData.length; index++) {\n      array.push(\"\")\n    }\n    return array\n  })\n  const scrollX = React.useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;\n  function handleScroll(){\n    console.log(index)\n    //check that result is good\n    if(index+1>LessonData.length-1){\n      navigation.navigate(\"Try\")\n    }\n    else{\n      flatListRef.current.scrollToIndex({animated: true, index: index+1});\n      setIndex(prev=>prev+1)\n    }\n    //explosion.current.start()\n  }\n  const renderItem = React.useCallback(\n    ({ item }) => {\n      return (\n        <View style={[styles.itemContainer, { width: width }]}>\n            <FootPrint style={{color:\"black\", }}>Lesson {item.key}</FootPrint>\n            {item.image?<Image resizeMode=\"cover\" source={item.image} style={styles.image}/>:null}\n            <InfoCard item={item}/>\n            <TextInput label=\"Code\" mode=\"outlined\" multiline selectionColor=\"black\"\n            theme={{ colors: { primary: 'black'}}}\n            underlineColor=\"transparent\" autoCapitalize={\"none\"} style={{height:100, width:\"90%\"}} />\n        </View>\n      );\n    },\n    [width]\n  );\n  const keyExtractor = React.useCallback((item) => item.key, []);\n  return (\n    <Background>\n      <FlatList\n        ref={flatListRef}\n        data={LessonData}\n        keyExtractor={keyExtractor}\n        scrollEnabled={true}\n        showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}\n        onScroll={Animated.event(\n          [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { x: scrollX } } }],\n          {\n            useNativeDriver: false,\n          }\n        )}\n        style={{height:\"100%\"}}\n        pagingEnabled\n        horizontal\n        decelerationRate={'normal'}\n        scrollEventThrottle={16}\n        renderItem={renderItem}\n      />\n      <View style={styles.text}>\n        <View style={styles.dotContainer}>\n          <ExpandingDot\n            data={LessonData}\n            expandingDotWidth={30}\n            scrollX={scrollX}\n            inActiveDotColor={'#55CE8C'}\n            activeDotColor={'#1FBD67'}\n            inActiveDotOpacity={0.5}\n            dotStyle={{\n              width: 10,\n              height: 10,\n              borderRadius: 5,\n              marginHorizontal: 3,\n              marginTop:10,\n              marginBottom:0\n            }}\n          />\n        </View>\n      </View>\n      <ActionButton title={\"Continue\"} onPress={()=>handleScroll()}/>\n      {/* <ConfettiCannon\n        count={100}\n        origin={{x: 200, y: 0}}\n        autoStart={false}\n        ref={ref => (explosion.current = ref)}\n        fallSpeed={2000}\n        fadeOut\n      /> */}\n      {/*  */}\n    </Background>\n  );\n};\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  text: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent:\"flex-end\"\n  },\n  dotContainer: {\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignSelf: 'center',\n  },\n  itemContainer: {\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    borderRadius: 20,\n    flex:1\n  },\n  image:{\n      width:400,\n      height:200,\n      borderWidth:5,\n      borderRadius:10\n  }\n});\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
